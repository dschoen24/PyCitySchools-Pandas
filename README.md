#PyCitySchools
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

-	I chose PyCitySchools because it looked a little more challenging than Heroes of Pymoli and because of this, I felt I would be able to apply more of what I have learned in class and gain more coding experience by choosing PyCitySchools to prepare me better for outside of class.

-	Code Breakdown: (Jupyter Notebook used for Code – CitySchoolsAnalysis.ipynb) - File can be found in pycityschools folder

District Summary – Created a high-level snapshot in table form of the school district’s key metrics to include: Total Schools, Total Students, Total Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading and % Overall Passing.

Analysis of District Summary – Total Schools = 15 / Total Students = 39,170 / Total Budget = $24,649,428.00 / Average Math Score = 78.98% / Average Reading Score = 81.87% / % Passing Math = 74.98% / % Passing Reading = 85.80% / % Overall Passing = 65.17%

School Summary – Created an overview table that summarized key metrics about each school based on the previous columns used.

Analysis for Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) – The top 5 performing schools were all Charter Schools, had fewer students and seems to cost slightly less based on per student budget.

Analysis for Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing) – Reverse of the top performing schools in which the top 5 Bottom Performing Schools were all District schools, had double the amount of total students and seems to cost more per student than Charter Schools.

Math & Reading Scores by Grade – Created a table that lists the average math score for students of each grade level 9th through 12th at each school.

Analysis for Math & Reading Scores by Grade – Shows that basically, the math and reading scores remain consistent from the start at 9th grade through end at 12th grade.  Very little variance between the scores.

Scores by School Spending – Created a table that breaks down school performances based on average spending ranges per student.

Analysis for Scores by School Spending – Schools that spend less per student show the highest percentile of % Overall Passing across Math and Reading.  As spending per student increases, % Overall Passing decreases.

Scores by School Size – Created the same table as I did for Scores by School Spending but based on School Size so I just had to tweak the code slightly.

Analysis of Scores by School Size – Small and Medium sized schools are relatively the same across all the elements of Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading and % Overall Passing while the Large size school decreases significantly.  The larger the school, the lower % of Overall students passing.

Scores by School Type – Copied the same code used for Scores by School Size and just changed Size to Type in most of the code.

Analysis of Scores by School Type – In general, Charter schools have a higher average in math and reading scores as well as higher percentage of students passing math and reading that the District schools.  Charter schools have a significant higher percentage rate overall of students passing both math and reading combined than District schools.
